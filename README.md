 This app is an interactive room organizer designed for visualizing and managing spaces, from entire rooms to specific areas like closets or racks. It features a vertical tab sidebar for creating and renaming sections, a canvas area where users can draw walls or dividers and place resizable boxes to represent storage elements like racks or drawers. The toolbar provides tools for drawing, line creation, and box placement. Users can add detailed item lists to each box and save or load their designs via Excel files. The app offers a versatile way to plan and organize spaces directly in the browser.
